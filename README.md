# WEBSITE

The first project is to build a showcase website.
The website should:

1. Tell us about you;
2. Talk about why you’d like to move into a career as a web developer;
3. Showcase what you’ve learnt so far;
4. Be built only using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript;
   Not use external libraries (e.g. Bootstrap, React, Jekyll themes);
5. Be hosted on GitHub Pages;
6. Link back to the GitHub repo with the code for your website.
